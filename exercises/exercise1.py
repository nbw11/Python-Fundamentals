    # prit('hello world')
# NameError: name 'prit' is not defined. Did you mean: 'print'?

# Can you make sense of the error message?
# I feel like i was able to make sense of the error message, it gave me a "did you mean?" which was cool

# Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error?
# I suppose you could just spell something in the message wrong.
# Why do you think it didn’t make an error?
# It wouldn't create an error because it's possible to want to display a misspelled message.

# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
